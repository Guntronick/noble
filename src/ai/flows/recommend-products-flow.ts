Your goal is to provide personalized product category recommendations based on a user's viewing history.

Analyze the following list of recently viewed products:
{{#each viewedProducts}}
- Name: {{name}}
  Category: {{category}}
  Description: {{description}}
{{/each}}

Based on this history, determine the user's primary interests.
Generate a short summary of these interests.
Then, identify the top 2-3 most relevant and distinct category slugs that would appeal to this user.
The slugs should be derived from the 'Category' field of the viewed products. For example if a category is "Tazas y Mates", the slug could be "tazas-y-mates". If the category is "Indumentaria", the slug could be "indumentaria".

Return your response in the specified JSON format.
